# /specforge:review

You are starting the **review** phase. Work from the project root.

## Gate

Run `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/state.py" get`. If there is no state, the state is corrupt, or `spec_approved` and `plan_approved` are not both `true`, refuse and say what is missing. Then run `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/state.py" set-phase review`.

## Steps

1. Run the **full test** suite (use `test_command` from `.spec/config.json` if set, otherwise the project's usual runner). Keep the complete output.

2. Run a fresh `specforge:code-reviewer` subagent. It must not inherit your build context. Give it `.spec/spec.md`, `.spec/plan.md`, and the diff of the feature branch against its base branch. It reports, per acceptance criterion, the implementing code, the covering test, and any problems.

3. Check the git history for red before green. Run `git log --reverse --format=%s` on the feature branch. For each task, a `test:` commit must appear before the `feat:` commit that implements it. List every violation under Gaps.

4. Write `.spec/review.md` from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/spec-writing/templates/review.md`:
   - Cover every AC from `.spec/spec.md` in the coverage table, with the code location (`file:line`), the test (`file::name`) and a status of pass, fail or missing.
   - Gaps found: missing or weak tests, uncovered edge cases, red-before-green violations, code outside the spec, and the reviewer's findings. Write "None" only if there really are none.
   - Test results: the full output from step 1.

5. Commit `.spec/review.md` with a `docs:` prefix. Then open the pull request: `git push -u origin <branch>` followed by `gh pr create`. Use the review summary as the body. If any AC is failing or missing, or the suite fails, add `--draft`. If `gh` is not available or there is no remote, say so and give the user the commands to run.

6. Report to the user: the PR link, a table of ACs with their status, and the gaps.

## Rules

- Never merge. Do not run `gh pr merge` or `git merge`, and do not enable auto-merge. Merging is the user's decision.
- Do not fix code in this phase. Report gaps and let the user decide whether to go back to `/specforge:build`.
- Never edit .spec/state.json.
