# /specforge:spec

Feature description from the user: $ARGUMENTS

You are starting the **spec** phase of a specforge workflow. Work from the project root. Do not write any code in this phase.

## Steps

1. If the feature description above is empty, ask the user what they want to build and wait.

2. Check for existing state: run `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/state.py" get`.
   - If it reports no state, run `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/state.py" init`.
   - If state exists and the spec is already approved, tell the user that editing `.spec/spec.md` will bump the spec version and reset both approvals, and ask whether to continue. Stop if they say no.
   - If state is corrupt, report the error and stop. Do not repair it yourself.

3. Ask up to 5 clarifying questions, and only ones whose answers change the spec. Put them in one message. Skip this if the description is already unambiguous. Wait for the answers.

4. Load the `spec-writing` skill, then write these files from its templates:
   - `.spec/requirement.md` from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/spec-writing/templates/requirement.md`
   - `.spec/spec.md` from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/spec-writing/templates/spec.md`. Every acceptance criterion gets a stable ID (AC-1, AC-2, ...) and is observable and testable. Fill Goal, Scope, Out of Scope, Acceptance Criteria and Edge Cases.
   - `CLAUDE.md` in the project root from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/spec-writing/templates/root-CLAUDE.md`. If a `CLAUDE.md` already exists, append the specforge section instead of overwriting it.

5. Run the `specforge:spec-reviewer` subagent on `.spec/spec.md` and `.spec/requirement.md`. Fix every issue it reports that is a real problem, and re-run it once if you made substantial changes.

6. **Stop.** Summarize the spec (goal, number of acceptance criteria, open questions) and tell the user to review `.spec/spec.md`. Tell them that when they are happy, they should run `/specforge:approve spec`, then `/specforge:plan`. Do not start planning and do not approve anything yourself.
