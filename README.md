# specforge

A Claude Code plugin for spec-driven development with human approval gates.

You describe a feature. Claude writes a spec with numbered acceptance criteria, you approve it, Claude plans and writes failing tests, you approve that, and only then does Claude write code. Hooks enforce the gates, so Claude cannot skip them.

## Install

Requirements: Claude Code 2.1.295 or later, `python3` and `git` on your PATH, and `gh` if you want `/specforge:review` to open pull requests.

Do the steps in order. Enter slash commands one at a time: type one, press Enter, then type the next. Pasting several together fails. Keep the path on a single line, because a path that wraps across lines is read wrongly.

1. **Add the marketplace.** Use the absolute path of your clone of this repository (for example `/Users/you/code/specforge`).

    Inside Claude Code:

    ```
    /plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/specforge
    ```

    Or from a shell:

    ```
    claude plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/specforge
    ```

2. **Install the plugin.** In a separate command:

    ```
    /plugin install specforge@specforge-marketplace
    ```

    Or from a shell:

    ```
    claude plugin install specforge@specforge-marketplace
    ```

3. **Check that it is installed.** From a shell, `claude plugin list` should show `specforge@specforge-marketplace` with `Status: enabled`.

4. **Reload.** In a session that was already open, run `/reload-plugins` (or restart Claude Code). Type `/specforge:` and you should see the six commands: `spec`, `plan`, `build`, `review`, `status` and `approve`.

To uninstall, run `claude plugin marketplace remove specforge-marketplace` in a shell. Because the marketplace is a local folder, edits you make to the plugin take effect on the next `/reload-plugins`.

## Usage step by step

Do steps 1 and 2 once per project. From step 3 on, this is the loop for every feature.

1. **Prepare a project.** Any folder under git works. For a Python example:

    ```
    mkdir my-project && cd my-project
    git init -b main
    python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install pytest
    printf '.venv/\n__pycache__/\n.pytest_cache/\n' > .gitignore
    git add -A && git commit -m "chore: init"
    ```

2. **Tell specforge how to run your tests.** Create `.spec/config.json`:

    ```json
    { "test_command": ".venv/bin/pytest -q" }
    ```

    You can skip this if `pytest`, `npm test` or `flutter test` already works from the project root. Specforge finds those on its own. If it cannot find a runner, commits are blocked with a message telling you to set `test_command`.

3. **Start Claude Code in the project folder** with `claude`, then run `/specforge:status`. Expect it to say there is no workflow yet.

4. **Describe the feature.** Run `/specforge:spec <what you want to build>`, for example `/specforge:spec REST API for todos: create, list, complete, delete. In memory, no auth.` Answer up to 5 questions. Expect `.spec/requirement.md`, `.spec/spec.md` with numbered criteria (AC-1, AC-2, ...) and a root `CLAUDE.md`, a `spec-reviewer` verdict, and then a stop. Claude does not start planning.

5. **Review `.spec/spec.md`.** Edit it or ask Claude to change it. Changes before approval cost nothing.

6. **Approve the spec.** Run `/specforge:approve spec`. Expect `spec_approved` to become true in `.spec/state.json`. Until you do this, `/specforge:plan` refuses and edits to code folders and test folders are blocked.

7. **Plan.** Run `/specforge:plan`. Expect `.spec/plan.md` with tasks tagged by AC-ID, folders each with a short `CLAUDE.md`, and failing tests written from the acceptance criteria only. Source folders are still blocked at this point. Claude stops again.

8. **Review the plan and the tests**, then run `/specforge:approve plan`. Now the source folders are open and `/specforge:build` can run.

9. **Build.** Run `/specforge:build`, or choose how often it pauses with `/specforge:build --mode strict` (every task), `--mode checkpoint` (every milestone, the default) or `--mode auto` (only risky actions). Expect a `feature/...` branch and, per task, a `test:` commit, a `feat:` commit and, if needed, a `refactor:` commit. Answer its approval questions when it pauses. If the same test fails 3 times, it stops and reports.

10. **Know what gets blocked.** While the suite fails, any commit that is not a `test:` commit is blocked and Claude is shown the test output. Direct edits to `.spec/state.json` are always blocked. Claude will read the reason and fix the problem, so you rarely have to step in.

11. **Check progress at any time** with `/specforge:status`. It shows the phase, approvals, spec version and what is pending.

12. **Review.** When the build is done, run `/specforge:review`. Expect a fresh `code-reviewer` pass and `.spec/review.md` mapping every AC to its code, its test and a status, plus gaps and the full test output. Then it pushes the branch and opens a pull request. That needs a git remote and `gh`; without them Claude gives you the commands instead. It never merges.

13. **Merge the pull request yourself** if you are happy with it.

If you change `.spec/spec.md` after approving it, the spec version goes up and both approvals reset. Review the change, run `/specforge:approve spec` again, and re-run `/specforge:plan` if the plan needs to change. To start over completely, delete the `.spec` folder.

## Workflow

```
 /specforge:spec <description>
        |  questions -> requirement.md, spec.md (AC-1, AC-2, ...), CLAUDE.md
        |  spec-reviewer checks it
        v
   [ YOU: /specforge:approve spec ]          spec_approved = true
        v
 /specforge:plan
        |  plan.md (tasks -> AC-IDs), folders + short CLAUDE.md files,
        |  test-writer creates FAILING tests from the acceptance criteria
        v
   [ YOU: /specforge:approve plan ]          plan_approved = true
        v
 /specforge:build [--mode strict|checkpoint|auto]
        |  feature branch; per task: RED (test:) -> GREEN (feat:) -> REFACTOR (refactor:)
        |  pauses by mode; stops after 3 failures of the same test
        v
 /specforge:review
        |  fresh code-reviewer, review.md (every AC -> code -> test),
        |  full test results, then a pull request (never merged)
        v
      done            /specforge:status shows where you are at any time
```

If `.spec/spec.md` changes after approval, the spec version goes up and both approvals reset. You approve again before work continues.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/specforge:spec <description>` | Asks up to 5 clarifying questions, writes `requirement.md`, `spec.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, runs `spec-reviewer`, then stops. |
| `/specforge:plan` | Refuses unless the spec is approved. Writes `plan.md`, folders with short `CLAUDE.md` files, and failing tests. Stops. |
| `/specforge:build [--mode strict\|checkpoint\|auto]` | Refuses unless spec and plan are approved. Builds on a feature branch with red, green, refactor per task. |
| `/specforge:review` | Fresh `code-reviewer`, writes `review.md`, opens a PR. Never merges. |
| `/specforge:status` | Read-only: phase, approvals, spec version, build mode, pending items. |
| `/specforge:approve spec\|plan` | Records your approval. Only you can run it: the model is not allowed to invoke it. |

Build modes: `strict` pauses after every task, `checkpoint` (default) after each milestone, `auto` only before risky actions such as deleting files, changing dependencies, migrations, external calls or force pushes.

## Gates

State lives in `.spec/state.json` in your project:

```json
{ "phase": "spec", "spec_approved": false, "plan_approved": false,
  "spec_version": 1, "build_mode": "checkpoint" }
```

Hooks read it and block with a clear reason on stderr:

| Gate | Rule |
|---|---|
| Edits to source folders (`src`, `app`, `lib`, at any depth) | Blocked until `spec_approved` and `plan_approved` are both true. |
| Edits to test folders (`tests`, at any depth) | Blocked until `spec_approved` is true. This lets the plan phase write failing tests. |
| `CLAUDE.md` files inside those folders | Treated like tests: allowed once the spec is approved. |
| Edits to `.spec/state.json` | Always blocked. Approvals go through `/specforge:approve`. Shell commands that write to it are blocked too, on a best-effort basis. |
| `git commit` | Once both approvals are in, blocked while the test suite fails. Commits whose message starts with `test:` are let through, so failing tests (RED) can be committed. |
| Spec changes | Editing `.spec/spec.md` after approval bumps `spec_version` and resets both approvals. |

Everything else is allowed, including everything under `.spec/`. A project with no `.spec/` folder is left alone. If the state or config file is unreadable, or a hook script fails, the hook blocks rather than guessing.

## Configuration

Optional `.spec/config.json`:

```json
{
  "code_dirs": ["src", "app", "lib", "backend"],
  "test_dirs": ["tests", "spec_tests"],
  "test_command": "make test"
}
```

- `code_dirs`: folder names (not paths) that count as source code. Default `src`, `app`, `lib`.
- `test_dirs`: folder names that count as tests. Default `tests`. A path inside both, such as `app/tests/x.py`, counts as a test.
- `test_command`: how to run the suite. If unset, specforge looks for `pytest`, then `npm test`, then `flutter test`. If it finds none, or the runner is not installed, commits are blocked with a message telling you to set it.

## Example session

A todo API, illustrative:

```
> /specforge:spec REST API for todos: create, list, complete, delete
Claude: A few questions: 1) Storage: in memory or SQLite? 2) Auth needed? ...
> In memory, no auth.
Claude: Wrote .spec/requirement.md, .spec/spec.md (6 acceptance criteria) and CLAUDE.md.
        spec-reviewer: READY FOR APPROVAL. Review .spec/spec.md, then run /specforge:approve spec.

> /specforge:plan
Claude: The spec is not approved. Review .spec/spec.md, then run /specforge:approve spec.
> /specforge:approve spec
Claude: Spec approved (version 1, 6 acceptance criteria). Next: /specforge:plan.

> /specforge:plan
Claude: Wrote .spec/plan.md: 2 milestones, 8 tasks. Created src/ and tests/ with CLAUDE.md files.
        test-writer created 9 failing tests (test_ac1_..., test_ac2_..., ...).
> /specforge:approve plan
Claude: Plan approved. Next: /specforge:build.

> /specforge:build --mode checkpoint
Claude: Branch feature/todo-api. T1 RED: test fails as expected. test: commit.
        T1 GREEN: full suite passes. feat: commit. ...
        Milestone 1 complete. Approve to continue?
> yes
Claude: ... all 8 tasks done, 9 tests passing. Run /specforge:review.

> /specforge:status
Phase: build. Spec approved: yes. Plan approved: yes. Spec version: 1.
Pending: no tasks left. Next: /specforge:review.

> /specforge:review
Claude: review.md written: AC-1..AC-6 all pass, no gaps.
        PR opened: https://github.com/you/todo-api/pull/1 (not merged).
```

## Troubleshooting

- **The `/specforge:` commands do not appear.** Run `/reload-plugins`, then open `/plugin` and check the Errors tab for a load error. From a shell, `claude plugin list` should show the plugin as enabled, and `claude plugin validate /absolute/path/to/specforge` should pass.
- **`/plugin marketplace add` fails.** Enter it on its own line with the whole path on one line, and use an absolute path. Pasting several commands at once, or a path that wrapped, is the usual cause.
- **Nothing is ever blocked.** Specforge only acts in projects that have a `.spec/` folder, which `/specforge:spec` creates. Also check that `python3` is on your PATH, because every hook runs through it, and that you reloaded or restarted after installing.
- **Everything is blocked, with "state.json is corrupt" or "missing".** Run `/specforge:status` to see the error. If `.spec/state.json` was damaged, delete the `.spec` folder and start again with `/specforge:spec`.
- **Commits are blocked with "test runner not found" or "no test command found".** Set `test_command` in `.spec/config.json` (see Configuration), and make sure the runner is installed in the environment Claude runs commands in.
- **A commit is blocked and you meant to commit failing tests.** Start the commit message with `test:`.
- **`/specforge:plan` or `/specforge:build` refuses.** It is telling you which approval is missing. Review the file it names and run the `/specforge:approve` command it gives.

## Limitations

- **TDD order is mostly instructions.** `/specforge:build` and the `test-writer` agent tell Claude to go red, green, refactor, and hooks block commits while tests fail. Nothing stops Claude from writing code and its test in one go. `/specforge:review` checks the git history and reports any task whose `test:` commit does not come before its `feat:` commit, but it reports, it does not block.
- **A `test:` commit can contain anything.** The prefix only skips the test run. The review step is where misuse shows up.
- **The Bash guard for `state.json` is best effort.** Hooks cannot reliably parse every shell command. Someone determined could write to the file by a route the pattern does not recognize, or run `state.py approve` through Bash. `/specforge:approve` cannot be invoked by the model, but the underlying script is a normal Python file.
- **The commit gate starts after both approvals.** Before that, no source code can be written, and committing planning documents with failing tests would deadlock the plan phase.
- **Hooks need Claude Code 2.1.295 or later** for `onFailure: block`. On older versions a crashing hook script does not block.
- `python3` must be on the PATH, and the test runner must be installed in the environment Claude runs commands in.

## Development

The plugin is built test first. Scripts have behavior tests, and prompts (commands, agents, skill, templates) have structure tests.

```
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install pytest
.venv/bin/pytest -q
claude plugin validate .
```

Layout:

```
.claude-plugin/   plugin.json, marketplace.json
commands/         spec, plan, build, review, status, approve
agents/           spec-reviewer, test-writer, code-reviewer
skills/           spec-writing (SKILL.md and templates)
hooks/hooks.json  gate wiring
scripts/          state.py, config.py, gate_check.py, test_gate.py
